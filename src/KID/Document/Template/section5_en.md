# What happens if the issuer is unable to pay out?

If the issuer becomes insolvent, investors should in the worst case be prepared to suffer a total loss of their investment. The product is not covered by any statutory or other deposit protection scheme. If the issuer and/or the guarantor are subject to any resolution measures, your claim rights may be reduced to zero, converted into equity or its maturity date may be altered.
